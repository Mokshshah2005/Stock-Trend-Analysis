# Stock Market Analysis and Prediction using LSTM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing stock market trends and predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain stock market data from a reliable source (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize data
   - Split into training and testing sets
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extract relevant features such as closing price, volume, moving averages, etc.
4. **Building the LSTM Model**:
   - Define the LSTM architecture
   - Compile the model
   - Train the model using historical data
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and accuracy
   - Compare predicted values with actual values
6. **Visualization**:
   - Plot actual vs predicted prices
   - Show trend analysis
7. **Making Predictions**:
   - Use the trained model to forecast future stock prices
8. **Conclusion and Insights**:
   - Summarize findings
   - Discuss improvements and limitations

## Methods Used
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time-series prediction.
- **Data Normalization**: Scaling data to improve model performance.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Used as a loss function to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for graphical representation of trends.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Expected Output
- Graphs showing actual vs predicted stock prices
- Model evaluation metrics
- Future stock price predictions
